# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project is to create an Earthquake Map with relation to the Tectonic Plates' location on the earth as well as map any earthquakes with a magnitude higher than 4.5.

The map will have three options for display :-

* The [Streets View]()
* The [Satellite View]()
* The [Dark View]()

The user is capable of toggling between each of the above types of map. The earthquake data for the last 7 days along with the tectonic maps are overlaid on each map. Each earthquake is represented by a circle marker and the color and size depends on the magnitude of the earthquake. A legend is displayed on the right hand bottom of the map that indicates the corelation between the color and the magnitude of the earthquakes. In addition, a map for all earthquakes greater than 4.5 will be also displayed.
